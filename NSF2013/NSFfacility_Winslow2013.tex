\section{Facilities, Equipment, and Other Resource}
The CUORE experiment is part of the larger underground laboratory at Gran Sasso. The laboratory provide the needed infrastructure to operate the experiment, and no money is requested in this proposal to support the infrastructure onsite.

At UCLA, there is a well equipped machine shop. There is also an excellent electrical shop including an experienced electrical engineer and technician. The electrical shop will be particularly useful for the construction of the slow monitory hardware. Both of these resources are available to the PI to help them successfully complete the work proposed in this grant. 

The PI has access to computing resources through the experiment. The PI also has devoted nodes and disks at UCLA's Hoffman2 Cluster.
