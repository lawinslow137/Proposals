\section{Facilities, Equipment, and Other Resource}
The CUORE and KamLAND experiments are part of larger underground laboratories. Double Chooz has two laboratories constructed especially for its operation. These laboratories provide the needed infrastructure to operate the experiments, and no money is requested in this proposal to support the infrastructure at these laboratories. 

At UCLA, there is an excellent machine shop and an excellent electrical shop including an experienced electrical engineer. Both of these resources are available to the PI to help them successfully complete the work proposed in this grant. The PI has access to computing resources through these experiments. The PI also has devoted nodes and disks at UCLA's Hoffman2 Cluster.
